# Build-Beautiful-Artistic-Maps-with-OSM-Data
Colombo is the commercial capital and largest city of Sri Lanka by population.  Here, I build a map for Colombo city to show its highways and railways using R with OSM (OpenStreetMap) data.

Libraries used - osmdata, sf, showtext, tidyverse (for ggplot2).
